# Spotify Authentication Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. White Screen on Login ✅
**Problem:** When clicking "Connect Spotify" in the Profile tab, the app would show a white screen instead of the Spotify login page.

**Root Cause:** 
- The app was using a `.sheet()` modifier with a `UIViewControllerRepresentable` wrapper
- This created a timing conflict where the sheet tried to present immediately while `ASWebAuthenticationSession` was also trying to present
- The double presentation caused the white screen

**Solution:**
- Removed the unnecessary `.sheet()` presentation
- Changed to direct `.onChange()` trigger that calls `connectSpotify(from: nil)` directly
- `ASWebAuthenticationSession` handles its own presentation context through `AuthPresenter`
- Simplified the flow by removing the `AuthSheetForProfile` struct entirely

**Files Modified:**
- `EmotionPlay/Views/ContentView.swift`

**Changes:**
```swift
// OLD - caused white screen
.sheet(isPresented: $showAuthSheet) {
  AuthSheetForProfile { vc in
    Task { await homeVM.connectSpotify(from: vc) }
  }
}

// NEW - works correctly
.onChange(of: showAuthSheet) { newValue in
  if newValue {
    Task {
      await homeVM.connectSpotify(from: nil)
      showAuthSheet = false
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. No Disconnect Functionality ✅
**Problem:** Clicking "Disconnect" button did nothing - user remained connected to Spotify even after clicking disconnect.

**Root Cause:**
- The `disconnectAction` closure in `ContentView` was empty: `disconnectAction: { /* optionally clear tokens, etc. */ }`
- `SpotifyAuthManager` had no `disconnect()` method to clear tokens
- UI state wasn't updated after disconnect

**Solution:**
- Added `disconnect()` method to `SpotifyAuthManager` that clears all tokens
- Implemented proper disconnect action in `ContentView` that:
  - Calls `auth.disconnect()` to clear tokens
  - Updates `homeVM.isAuthorized` to false
  - Clears `prefs.spotifyUsername`
- Added console logging for debugging

**Files Modified:**
- `EmotionPlay/Services/SpotifyAuthManager.swift`
- `EmotionPlay/Views/ContentView.swift`

**Changes:**
```swift
// Added to SpotifyAuthManager
func disconnect() {
  accessToken = nil
  refreshToken = nil
  expiresAt = nil
  cachedUserID = nil
  print("[SpotifyAuth] Disconnected - all tokens cleared")
}

// Updated in ContentView
disconnectAction: {
  auth.disconnect()
  homeVM.isAuthorized = false
  prefs.spotifyUsername = nil
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Login Flow:
1. User taps "Connect Spotify" in Profile tab
2. `showAuthSheet` state changes to `true`
3. `.onChange` detects the change and triggers authentication
4. `ASWebAuthenticationSession` presents its own Safari sheet
5. User logs in through Spotify's OAuth page
6. Callback returns to app with auth code
7. App exchanges code for tokens
8. UI updates to show "Connected" status

### Disconnect Flow:
1. User taps "Disconnect" button
2. `auth.disconnect()` clears all tokens from memory
3. `homeVM.isAuthorized` set to `false`
4. `prefs.spotifyUsername` cleared
5. UI updates to show "Not Connected" status
6. User can connect again at any time

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Click "Connect Spotify" opens Spotify login (not white screen)
- [x] Login completes and returns to app successfully
- [x] UI shows "Connected" status after login
- [x] Click "Disconnect" actually disconnects
- [x] UI shows "Not Connected" after disconnect
- [x] Can reconnect after disconnecting
- [x] App doesn't crash during auth flow
- [x] Token refresh works correctly

## Technical Notes

### ASWebAuthenticationSession Best Practices
- Always provide a `presentationContextProvider` (we use `AuthPresenter`)
- Set `prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession = true` for privacy
- Don't try to present it inside a sheet - let it present itself
- The session automatically handles safe area and presentation

### Token Management
- Access tokens expire (typically 1 hour)
- Refresh tokens are long-lived but can be revoked
- Always check `expiresAt` before using a token
- `ensureFreshToken()` handles automatic refresh

### State Management
- `SpotifyAuthManager` is `@ObservableObject` with `@Published` properties
- `isAuthorized` computed property checks both token existence and expiration
- `HomeViewModel.isAuthorized` tracks auth state for UI updates
- All state updates happen on `@MainActor`

## Potential Future Improvements

1. **Persistent Storage:**
   - Store refresh token in Keychain for persistence across app launches
   - Currently tokens are lost when app is closed

2. **Better Error Handling:**
   - Show specific error messages for different failure modes
   - Add retry logic for network failures
   - Handle revoked token scenarios gracefully

3. **User Feedback:**
   - Add loading indicator during login
   - Show success message after connection
   - Confirm before disconnecting

4. **Security:**
   - Move Client ID to secure configuration
   - Add token encryption at rest
   - Implement certificate pinning for API calls

5. **Token Refresh:**
   - Implement background refresh before expiration
   - Add retry logic for failed refreshes
   - Clear cached data on refresh failure

## Dependencies

- **AuthenticationServices**: For `ASWebAuthenticationSession`
- **Foundation**: For networking and JSON
- **SwiftUI**: For reactive UI updates

## Known Limitations

1. Tokens don't persist across app restarts (by design, for now)
2. No background token refresh
3. No offline mode support
4. Single user account only
5. Requires internet connection for all operations

## Debugging Tips

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Look for `[SpotifyAuth]` prefixed messages
   - Check for HTTP error responses

2. **Verify Spotify Dashboard:**
   - Ensure redirect URI matches exactly: `emotionplay://callback`
   - Client ID should be: `9aeb9fc2240446de9c56753250f1ef61`

3. **Check Info.plist:**
   - URL scheme should be registered: `emotionplay`
   - No `www.` prefix needed

4. **Test Auth Flow:**
   - Clear app data and test fresh install
   - Try both first-time auth and reconnection
   - Test with different Spotify accounts

## Migration Notes

These fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing code. No migration steps required.
